    <h1>Personality</h1>
    <p>Sans is often a lazy and laid back person, sleeping on the job and is almost never at his sentry station. His laziness is a combination of fatalism and apathy, as he is aware of  the timeline being reset. Conversely, he suggests that this knowledge could be "a poor excuse for being lazy." He enjoys being mischievous and primarily acts this way towards those he is on good terms with. His antics range from an assortment of illogical, juvenile, and slightly inconvenient pranks. A few examples of this is whenSans  tried to sell â€œfried snow," using whoopee cushions and using a buzz shocker when you first met him. He is not above utilising his teleportation or other magic for practical jokes either. Sans is also fond of making the occasional low-brow puns. He enjoys making others laugh in general, as he also performs at the MTT Resort as a comedian.Despite Sans being apathetic towards his own life, he is considerate to those he cares for. For example, Sans is a regular at Grillby's even though he never pays his tab and the monsters and Royal Guard dogs treat him kindly. Sans has informed Big Mouth about "all kinds of incredible foods," yet Big Mouth comments that "he always orders the worst burger off the menu." Eventhough Sans hates making promises, he respects  Toriel's request to watch out for any humans due to them being good friends. Even if the protagonist killed people that were close to him, Sans refrains from bringing up the topic until the Last Corridor. In a Neutral Route ending where Papyrus or Toriel is alive, Sans omits the protagonist's slaughter to either of them.
